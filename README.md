# The Contentious Politics Of AI
Our network offers a space for those who want to research, study, and make visible (and possible) ways that AI is, and can be, challenged. 

It is open to all -  academics, policy researchers, and activists interested in ways that AI is contested - see details below on how to sign up.

## Aims of the Network

At our [founding conference](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/government/events/2025/the-contentious-politics-of-ai-and-its-alternatives) in July 2025 we launched the network in order to bring together those interested in different ways in which AI is being, and can be, contested. In the spirit of our recent proposal for [ways to be 'anti-AI'](https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/gpe/4/2/article-p185.xml), we sought to open up a discussion for those concerned about the harms that AI might pose - be it ecological harm, heightened exploitation, racialised extractivism, rule by oligarchs, and/or the further degradation of what remains of our "democracies". 

As we noted at the time, we see widespread concern about how AI might bring about these harms - **but** **we need to think more about how AI might be contested**. We need to reject the 'inevitability narrative' - that there is no alternative to AI as we are coming to know it.

</p>

The aim of our network is to continue these goals - offering a space in which those interested in the contestation of AI can join and share insights, knowledge, updates, and find ways to collaborate around a broad interest in the contestation of AI. This includes campaigns, events, talks, research initiatives, organising actions, and generally facilitating discussions regarding how the introduction of AI is being subjected to challenges and public opposition of different types.

## Join us!

Whether you are an academic, a policy researcher, a trade unionist, or an activist, if you have an interest in pushing back against AI then we want you to get involved. 

We have a mailing list to keep up with announcements, events, and research opportunities, and where will also provide a regular newsletter updating on recent episodes, campaigns and events focused on the contestation of AI.

**October 2025**


At the micro-level we continue to see an ongoing series of everyday forms of 'misbehaviour' or subversion regarding the use of AI. A recent survey of company employees found that [over 30% were actively sabotaging their company's AI strategy](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cio.com/article/4022953/31-of-employees-are-sabotaging-your-gen-ai-strategy.html__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C-06aKa1w$), with the most likely reason given that the introduction of AI amounted to an explicit attempt to subvert the attempt to replace employee's jobs. Reflecting this trend, a recent McKinsey [report](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/seizing-the-agentic-ai-advantage__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C9CgqtcGw$) that while 80% of companies are introducing gen AI in some form, at the same time around 80% also report no improvement on their bottom line as a result of introducing AI; the report identifies a key reason as "implicit resistance from business teams and middle management due to fear of disruption, uncertainty around job impact, and lack of familiarity with the technology.". Likewise, the NYT [reported](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/07/business/ai-chatbot-prompts-resumes.html__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C_Q4RkqEA$) on attempts by job applicants to trick chatbot recruiters for job applications.  The Information [reports](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://archive.is/ggXs4*selection-1275.0-1275.237__;Iw!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C9rDRTprg$) on how coders are refusing to use AI tools to code, with two software engineers at Mixus, San Francisco, staging a rebellion by [refusing](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://archive.is/ggXs4*selection-1275.0-1275.237__;Iw!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C9rDRTprg$) to follow instructions to rely on AI coding-assistance software. Higher up the hierarchy within AI companies, the FT [reported](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ft.com/content/21ec5a5f-0e9a-49b9-b64d-9ebc88e70aa7__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C8MqUuHTA$) an exodus from disgruntled senior staff from Musk's xAI.  Also as a result of worker opposition, Microsoft [announced](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/25/technology/microsoft-israel-defense-ministry.html__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C9k5T0BKw$) it would disable some services to Israel’s Defense Ministry, after a company review concluded that Israel was using Microsoft’s cloud storage services to hold surveillance data on Palestinians - this came after disgruntled employees entered company president, Brad Smith’s office, to protest, hang banners and occupy rooms in the company HQ.

In terms of regulation, we have seen a number of key developments. This includes the introduction of the new California AI Companion Law (SB243), as this [piece](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://doesnotcomputeai.substack.com/p/california-passes-the-worlds-first__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C-i-lKlGA$) from James Muldoon reports. Newsom also [signed](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/29/newsom-signs-ai-law-00585348__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C_16jiACA$) the first AI Safety Law (SB53) in California - as also [reported](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/29/california-governor-newsom-signs-landmark-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C9QJy0dzg$) in more detail here by techcrunch- although he also [vetoed](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://thehill.com/policy/technology/5553487-newsom-signs-ai-safety-bill/__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C8fZFqKdw$) another piece of legislation (AB1064) that sought to restrict access to AI for children. An AI Risk Evaluation Act was [introduced](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://controlai.news/p/before-the-cliff-regulating-ai__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C9E_Z_pcw$) into the US Senate. The much-vaunted UK's AI Bill also still remains [waiting](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://controlai.news/p/before-the-cliff-regulating-ai__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C9E_Z_pcw$) in the pipeline. Calls for further regulations were also voiced. Perhaps most visibly, the [Global Call for AI Red Lines](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://red-lines.ai/__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C-2XzNhjw$) saw over 300 prominent figures call for governments to reach international agreements regarding red lines for AI. Similarly, a group of leading experts in Cognitive Sciences [signed an Open Letter](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://zenodo.org/records/17065099__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C9KAYJV0g$) called for the rejection of the uncritical introduction of AI in academia. For a more global summary of AI policies and regulations, do see the excellent new Artificial Intelligence Policy Observatory for the World of Work (AIPOWW) Symposium in the [current issue](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/gpe/4/2/gpe.4.issue-2.xml__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C8iWLkSKQ$) of the journal, Global Political Economy. This reports on the work of the Artificial Intelligence Policy Observatory for the World of Work, based at University of Essex’s Centre for Commons Organising, Values Equalities and Resilience and which is led by Phoebe V. Moore and Peter Bloom (both members of our Contentious Politics Of AI Network). It includes excellent commentaries on AI policies and regulations in the [EU](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/gpe/4/2/article-p201.xml__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C_p_J1-AQ$), [Brazil](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/gpe/4/2/article-p215.xml__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C_vtEqOIw$), [India](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/gpe/4/2/article-p228.xml__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C8eiMUOQg$), [China](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/gpe/4/2/article-p243.xml__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C8cfH4I7w$), and [Canada](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://bristoluniversitypressdigital.com/view/journals/gpe/4/2/article-p256.xml__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C_qAlosow$).

The wider impact of AI-related infrastructure is also being contested. Efforts to oppose the building of data centres are growing in prominence. Earlier this year saw reports of the Sierra Club seeking to overturn the licence for a data centre as part of their [campaign](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://nevadacurrent.com/2025/01/10/effort-to-block-reno-data-center-offers-glimpse-of-increasingly-thorny-issue-in-nevada/__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C9Q6A8Kmw$) in Reno, Nevada. MIT Technology Review covered a  related [campaign](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116287/ai-data-centers-nevada-water-reno-computing-environmental-impact/__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C-XYQTdFA$) by the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe to tackle the use of water by data centres that threatens to divert it away from the Pyramid Lake. More generally, the impact of AI on energy costs is starting to have political consequences. With voters increasingly calling for political measures to offset or reduce the impact of AI energy use on household energy costs. In the US, Democrats, led by Elizabeth Warren, have sought to politicise the issue and [called](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://archive.is/0aBqV__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C__kGx4mw$) for Trump to act. A recent election in Virginia saw both the Democrat and Republican candidates cite the rise in electricity costs as a key reason why the building of any new data centres should be [blocked](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.semafor.com/article/10/13/2025/as-electricity-bills-rise-candidates-in-both-parties-blame-data-centers__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C8ja4ioSA$). This reflects a more general trend whereby [public opinion](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/10/07/ai-public-opinion-mistrust__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C-8TNKFyg$) in the US is becoming increasingly sceptical about the merits of AI. As the Atlantic [reports](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/10/cheaper-tesla-elon-musk-trump/684528/__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C-SIQ57yA$), the ongoing negative public opinion of Musk continues to have a detrimental impact on the introduction of AI technologies with Tesla.

Finally, in terms of legal challenges, Anthropic agreed a much-reported $1.5billion copyright [settlement](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/us-judge-approves-15-billion-anthropic-copyright-settlement-with-authors-2025-09-25/__;!!CF15FET90Tp8!Dzz4DY7fBf9sPwFhJhRD-iGU0xk1hRwxvLyTRK37Vp0G3ubDhPKklH3GW-EW1z5lCP95py811hD93tCCJFauT8porePN7C-vL3gzWw$) to resolve the copyright class action brought against it.
